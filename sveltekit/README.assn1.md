## Needs Analysis

The goal of the EzEval project is to address the need for a tool that meets the specific needs of window cleaners. Currently, there are few options available that offer features like customizable price sheets, the ability to hide pricing from evaluators, and direct quote sending with management approval. This lack of suitable tools creates a number of problems in the industry, and the EzEval app aims to uniquely solve these issues. With its targeted features and functionality, EzEval is designed to meet the specific needs of window cleaning companies and help them streamline their project evaluation and quoting process.

There are other window quote tools available, but none that offer the specific features and benefits of EzEval. Many window cleaners currently rely on traditional methods such as writing notes on paper and returning them to the office, or making estimates based on their own observations, which can be perceived as less transparent, or even less honest, by customers. EzEval provides a more transparent and accurate process for evaluating and quoting projects, allowing customers to see exactly how quotes are determined. The tool also enables users to capture detailed project information that can be used to update pricing for recurring customers without the need for re-evaluation. This sets EzEval apart from other window quote tools on the market.

EzEval is a tool designed specifically for exterior cleaning companies. It aims to help these companies close more deals by creating authenticity and transparency with their clients. One way it does this is by capturing more information about a given property than other tools, which can help to build trust with clients. In addition, the tool offers features like customizable price sheets, the ability to hide pricing from evaluators, and the option to send quotes directly to customers or office managers for approval, which can help to streamline the quoting process and make it more efficient for cleaning companies.

## Stakeholders

### Sponsors

While this project currently has no sponsors, I am actively looking for sponsorship opportunities. If you are interested in sponsoring this project, please contact me at [ryan@roga.dev](mailto:ryan@roga.dev)

### Clients

I have lined up a few clients who are interested in using and testing the EzEval app. These clients are currently using other tools to evaluate and quote projects, and are interested in trying out EzEval to see if it can help them streamline their process. As part of the development process I will be setting up a pilot program with these clients to test the app and gather feedback.

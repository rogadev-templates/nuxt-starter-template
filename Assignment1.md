# Needs Analysis

## Pain Points & Existing Challenges

**Difficulty in pricing different types of jobs.**<br>
Different types of jobs, such as residential and commercial, often require different pricing structures. Many window cleaning companies struggle with creating these pricing structures effectively. There currently exists no tool that does price sheets and job evaluation the way this app intends to do.

**Inefficient and time-consuming quote creation process.**<br>
Many window cleaning companies struggle with creating accurate and detailed quotes in a timely manner, resulting in delays and lost business opportunities. Evaluating a project poorly or failing to capture enough information about the project you’re bidding on can result in lost revenue, unexpected costs, having to re-evaluate a project, and missed opportunities.

**Lack of transparency for clients.**<br>
A shortcut that some window cleaning companies take is commonly referred to as “guestimation”. Guestimation involves arriving at a number seemingly by shaking a magic 8-ball or sticking their finger in the wind. Clients are uncertain about the accuracy and fairness of these quotes, as they are not privy to the pricing structures and evaluations used by the window cleaning company. This results in lost business, especially when a competitor offers a more transparent quote that explains the price and details the scope of work.

**Difficulty in adding up-sells to quotes.**<br>
Often, window cleaning companies struggle with identifying and adding up-sells to quotes, resulting in lost revenue opportunities. When you send an estimator to evaluate a window cleaning project, they may overlook opportunities like gutter cleaning, pressure washing, and more. By capturing detailed property information and metrics, estimators are forced to see aspects of a project that would otherwise be overlooked.

**Lack of security for confidential pricing information**<br>
Many window cleaning companies are concerned about the security of their proprietary pricing information, which can be exploited by employees or competitors. By capturing property metrics instead of arriving at hard fast numbers, an estimator can hand an evaluation over to a manager who will build the quote accordingly, approve, and send it to the client directly.

## Experience

The project utilizes SvelteKit Framework, a modern and lightweight full-stack framework that allows for efficient and easy development of web applications. For styling, the project uses TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework, and TailwindUI for a small number of pre-designed UI components, to ensure a consistent and visually appealing user interface with good affordance.

The primary site uses Astro, a modern static site generator that allows for easy and efficient development of static sites. We're also using an Astro theme that leverages TailwindCSS called Astrowind. The purpose of the static site is to provide a landing page for the application, as well as a place to host the documentation and other information about the application. It needs to have excellent SEO and be easy to maintain. In addition, Astro offers us a way to create a blog which will help in providing customers with updates, news, and other information about the application.

For the back-end, the project utilizes Prisma which provides full-stack type safety for the database. Prima is a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that ensures type safety and provides a convenient way to interact with the database. The project also uses Prisma Client, a powerful database client that allows for easy and efficient GUI interface with the database for troubleshooting, hot fixing, and maintainability. The project utilizes Supabase, a powerful and scalable PostgreSQL database  that ensures optimal performance and scalability. In addition to Prisma, I also plan to use Zod for full-stack type safety. Zod is a powerful TypeScript library that allows for easy and efficient type checking and validation of data.

For end-to-end testing, the project uses Playwright. This end-to-end testing tool allows for accurate and efficient testing of the application. For unit testing, the project uses Vitest - a unit test framework built on Vite with an eye for speed and minimal config.

As the developer of this project, I have over 6 years of experience in the window cleaning industry, having built from the ground up the award-winning exterior cleaning company, MossAway, as well as Comox Window Cleaning. For my summer co-op, I developed a full-stack web app for VIU that made it to production. That project was built using the SvelteKit release candidate, and I’ve also used Supabase on a number of personal projects. With my experience in the industry and the technology stack I’m using, I feel very well-equipped to tackle this project and ensure its success.

## Costs

### Supabase ($25/mo USD)

While it does have a free tier, at that level your database will “go to sleep” if it doesn’t get accessed within 48 hours. This causes slow cold-starts every so often and a poor user experience. The paid tier also adds additional features which will improve scalability and performance.

### Domain ($20/yr)

The domain `[ezeval.app](http://ezeval.app)` has already been purchased for a cost of $20 for the first year and ~$20/yr after that.
